                <h3>History Of Our Store</h3>
                <p>Many people dream big, but few people actually achieve their goals of being a successful business owner – and surpass
                those goals. Bart Churchward, president of Bart’s Car Store, dreamed of being an entrepreneur since he was a kid. He set
                a deadline to be in business for himself by the age of 30. He achieved that goal three years late, but he has managed to
                surpass his own expectations, and those of others, by owning one of the most successful and trusted used-car dealership
                groups in the area.</p>
